 <summary>Remake of the 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli</summary>

  <p>
   Use the cursor keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number
   touch, they will merge into one with its number doubled. After every move a
   new tile with either 2 or 4 is spawned in a random free cell. Try merging 
   the tiles into 2048 to win the game. The game is over when the board is full
   and no more blocks can be spawned after your move.

  <p>
  	Gnome 2048 is a remake of the 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli GNOME and
  	other GTK+ 3 compatible desktop environments.
